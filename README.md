# IMAGE_COMPETETION_ANALYTICSCOSM for Social Media
This competition will require you to collect data from social media and classify images as shareable and non-shareable and predict the likes on the upcoming post. Each user and user post i.e.image post comes with a lot of inherent attributes like the color, content, subject, context, message etc. These are subjective qualities(followers,hastags,comments,followings etc.) and you need to assign meaning to these attributes through your model. There are plenty of variables you can derive based on above. Your task will be to develop an algorithm that can classify images and other data of the user so that you can predict the upcoming posts and predict the likes on the basis of that.
