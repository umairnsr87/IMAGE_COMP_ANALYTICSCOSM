# IMAGE_COMP_ANALYTICS_COS_M
This competition will require you to collect data from social media and classify images as shareable and non-shareable. Each image comes with a lot of inherent attributes like the color, content, subject, context, message etc. These are subjective qualities and you need to assign meaning to these attributes through your model. There are plenty of variables you can derive based on above. Your task will be to develop an algorithm that can classify images into shareable and non-shareable based on above tasks. Keep in mind- whether an image is shareable is completely a subjective decision and your model can only be correct, say 90% of the time.
